# FSharp.Charting: Point and Line Charts

*Summary:* This example shows how to create line and point charts in F#. 

A line or a point chart can be created using the `Chart.Line` and `Chart.Point` methods. When generating a
very large number of points or lines, it is better to use `Chart.FastLine` and `Chart.FastPoint`. These are special types
of charts that do not support as many visual features but are more efficient.

When using F# Interactive, each of these examples needs to be evaluated separately. This way, F# Interactive 
invokes a handler that automatically shows the created chart.

## A Simple Line Chart

The following example calls the `Chart.Line` method with a list of X and Y values as tuples. The snippet generates
values of a simple function, f(x)=x^2. The values of the function are generated for X ranging from 1 to 100. The chart generated is 
shown below.

*)

// On Mac OSX use FSharp.Charting.Gtk.fsx
#I "packages/FSharp.Charting"
#load "FSharp.Charting.fsx"

open FSharp.Charting
open System

(*** define-output:sq ***)
// Drawing graph of a 'square' function 
Chart.Line [ for x in 1.0 .. 100.0 -> (x, x ** 2.0) ]
(*** include-it:sq ***)

## Pipelining into Chart.Line

The following example generates a list containing both X and Y values. 
*)

(*** define-output:cu ***)
// Generates 2D curve using list of tuples
let curvyData = [ for i in 0.0 .. 0.02 .. 2.0 * Math.PI -> (sin i, cos i * sin i) ] 
curvyData |> Chart.Line
(*** include-it:cu ***)

## Specifying only Y values

The following example below shows that you may also simply give a set of Y values, rather than (X,Y) value pairs.
*)

(*** define-output:cy ***)
// Generates 2D curve using only Y values
Chart.Line [ for x in 1.0 .. 100.0 -> x * x * sin x ]
(*** include-it:cy ***)

It uses a sequence expression ranging
from 0 to 2Ï€ with a step size 0.02. This produces a large number of points, so the snippet uses the `Chart.Line`
method to draw the chart. When using a single list as the data source, it is also possible to elegantly use the pipelining (`|>` operator).

## A Point Chart

The following example shows how to generate a scatter plot. It uses a list to specify the X and Y coordinates of the points. 
*)

// Draw scatter plot  of points
let rnd = new Random()
let rand() = rnd.NextDouble()
let randomPoints = [ for i in 0 .. 1000 -> rand(), rand() ]

(*** define-output:rp ***)
Chart.Point randomPoints
(*** include-it:rp ***)

## Specifying Minimums, Maximums and other properties on a Line Chart

The following example shows how to set the name and Y axis minimum properties on the chart and use log-distribution for the X axis.
*)


(*** define-output:hd ***)
let highData = [ for x in 1.0 .. 100.0 -> (x, 3000.0 + x ** 2.0) ]
Chart.Line(highData,Name="Rates").WithYAxis(Min=2000.0).WithXAxis(Log=true)
(*** include-it:hd ***)

## Combining Line Charts

The following example shows how to combine several line charts and give each data set a name. A legend is added
automatically when names are used for data sets.

*)
let futureDate numDays = DateTime.Today.AddDays(float numDays)

let expectedIncome = 
  [ for x in 1 .. 100 -> 
      futureDate x, 1000.0 + rand() * 100.0 * exp (float x / 40.0) ]
let expectedExpenses = 
  [ for x in 1 .. 100 -> 
      futureDate x, rand() * 500.0 * sin (float x / 50.0) ]
let computedProfit = 
  (expectedIncome, expectedExpenses) 
  ||> List.map2 (fun (d1,i) (d2,e) -> (d1, i - e))

(*** define-output:co1 ***)
Chart.Line(expectedIncome,Name="Income")
(*** include-it:co1 ***)
(*** define-output:co2 ***)
Chart.Line(expectedExpenses,Name="Expenses")
(*** include-it:co2 ***)
(*** define-output:co3 ***)
Chart.Line(computedProfit,Name="Profit")
(*** include-it:co3 ***)

(*** define-output:co4 ***)
Chart.Combine(
   [ Chart.Line(expectedIncome,Name="Income")
     Chart.Line(expectedExpenses,Name="Expenses") 
     Chart.Line(computedProfit,Name="Profit") ])
(*** include-it:co4 ***)
