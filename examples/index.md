--------

* Many chart types: Area, Bar, BoxPlot, Bubble, Candlestick, Column, Doughnut, ErrorBar, FastLine, FastPoint, Funnel, Kagi, Line and more.
* 2D and pseudo-3D charting.
* Create charts directly from F# data.
* Use either fluent or pipelined chart specifications.
* Create updating 'LiveChart' charts from F# or Rx observables.
* Can be used in conjunction with the [FSharp.Data](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data) library</a>.

Limitations:

* Windows-only. This may change (i.e. cross-platform and web charting for a subset of chart specifications).

### Library philosophy

FSharp.Charting uses simple, declarative chart specifications.

On Windows, FSharp.Charting is implemented using the Data Visualization charting controls 
available on Windows in .NET 4.x.

### Library future

FSharp.Charting is designed so that the same charting specifications can be supported when 
using different charting implementations. For example, the [Try F#](http://tryfsharp.org)
charts use similar charting specifications, implemented using in HTML5 using Dojo Charts.

The next step we would like to try is to implement cross-platform Javascript-based charting using
embedded browser controls.

Another direction of interest is to bind to the server-side versions of the charting controls usable by ASP.NET.


### Library license

The library is available under Apache 2.0. For more information see the 
[License file][readme] in the GitHub repository. In summary, this means that you can 
use the library for commercial purposes, fork it, modify it as you wish.
